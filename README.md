# Patricks-monitor-script

I recently got a DHT22/AM2302 digital temperature and humidity sensor module on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a part of my new son Patrick's monitor system.
I am running this script every 30 mins to get the temperature and humidity of the room where he is.
I am also using a Pi NoIR camera module that streams video and stores some picts that are sent to a group of recipients every 30 mins.
